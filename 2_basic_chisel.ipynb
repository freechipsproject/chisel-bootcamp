    "Now that you're familiar with Scala, it's time to learn Chisel. Chisel is a hardware construction language (HCL), similar to a hardware design language but embedded in a higher level, functional programming language. The details and benefits of an HCL will be covered in later modules. This module introduces basic Chisel, which is quite similar to Verilog. Once the basics are understood, you can use them to construct parameterized generators and take full advantage of the language.\n",

If you are unfamiliar with LFSRs, skim the [Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear-feedback_shift_register) first. To do this, we will need to understand how combinational logic, sequential logic, operators, and data types are all handled in Chisel.\n",

Example declarations of Chisel literals and variables in various types are given below. `B` stands for boolean, which is functionally the same as a one-bit `UInt`. `U` stands for `UInt` or unsigned integer. `S` stands for `SInt` or signed integer. Note that the width of an `SInt` includes the sign bit, so a 4-bit `SInt` ranges from -8 to 7. Notice how all Chisel variables are Scala `val`s. Never use a Scala `var` for a hardware construct, since the construct may never change once defined, only its value may change.\n",

    "Conditional blocks can also be used to generate combinational logic. Let's say now that we want a counter that counts 0, 1, 2, then resets. In this case, since we need to reset on 2, we can no longer depend on the implicit integer overflow and need to make the logic explicit:\n",
