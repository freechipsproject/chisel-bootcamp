    "Now that you're familiar with Scala, it's time to learn Chisel. Chisel is a hardware construction language (HCL), similar to a hardware design language but embedded in a higher level, functional programming language. The details and benefits of an HCL will be covered in later modules. This module introduces basic Chisel, which is quite similar to Verilog. Once the basics are understood, you can use them to construct parameterized generators and take full advantage of the language.\n",

    "Throughout this module, the goal will be to produce a linear feedback shift register (LFSR) in hardware. If you are unfamiliar with LFSRs, gloss over the [Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear-feedback_shift_register) first. To do this, we will need to understand how combinational logic, sequential logic, operators, and data types are all handled in Chisel.\n",

S stands for SInt or signed integer. Note that the width of an SInt includes the sign bit, so a 4-bit SInt ranges from -8 to 7. Notice how all Chisel variables are Scala `val`s.

    "_We've now seen the basics of building combinational and sequential logic circuits, but those are very low-level primitives. Chisel provides a higher level of abstraction for some operations._\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conditional Register Updates\n",

While we've seen the update operator `:=` used combinationally on Module boundary `IO`s, it can be also applied to Module-internal `Wire`s. Here's an example of the counter above, styled slightly differently to make the combinational logic explicit and using `Wire`s.\n",
    "```scala\n",

    "\n",
    "### Conditional Combinational Updates\n",
    "Let's say now that we want a counter that counts 0, 1, 2, then resets. In this case, since we need to reset on 2, we can no longer depend on the implicit integer overflow and need to make the logic explicit:\n",

    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "As you can see from the example above, `when`-`otherwise` blocks behave like `if`-`else` blocks in Scala, but generate conditional hardware. `when` blocks also have an `.elsewhen (condition)`, much like `else if (condition)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "_Note that there is a `.` before the `elsewhen`, this due to limitations of Scala syntax._\n",
    "\n",
    "When there are multiple update operators that can apply at the same time, the last one takes priority. So the above example can be equivalently rewritten by unconditionally updating `nextReg` with the counter increment, then overriding it in the overflow case:\n",

    "As all `Module`s are classes, they can be instantiated using the `new` object syntax. However, they also must be wrapped in a `Module(...)` call. For example, to instantiate the 4-state counter example way above:\n",
