    "- It has a powerful and elegant library for manipulating various collections of data.\n",
    "- It has a rigorous type system that helps catch a large class of errors very early in the development cycle, i.e. at compilation.\n",

    "Code blocks are delimited by braces.  A block can contain zero or more lines of Scala code. The last line of Scala code becomes the return value (which may be ignored) of the code block.  A code block with no lines would return a special null-like object called `Unit`. Code blocks are used throughout Scala: they are the bodies of class definitions, they form function and method definitions, they are the clauses of `if` statements, and they are the bodies of `for` and many other Scala operators.\n",

The code block is called for each member of the list, and the code block returns that member converted to a String. Scala is almost excessively accepting of variations of this syntax. You might see this written in many different ways. This type of code block is called an anonymous function, and more details on anonymous functions are provided in a later module."

    "The goal here is to help you recognize the different notational types when you encounter them.  As you use Scala, these will seem more comfortable and familiar.  Authors tend to gravitate to particular styles, and there are also individual syntactical situations in which one notation will seem more natural. One-liners tend to use the more concise forms. Complex blocks usually have a more narrative appearance. To make collaboration easier, one should consider skimming through best practices found in the [Scala Style Guide](http://docs.scala-lang.org/style/)."

Parameters to class definitions also use this named argument scheme (they are actually just the parameters to the constructor method for the class).\n",
