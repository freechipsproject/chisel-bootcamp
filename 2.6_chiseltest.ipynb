    "The Chisel team has been working on an improved testing framework. \"ChiselTest\", it provides the following improvements .\n",
    "\n",
    "- suitable for both unit tests and system integration tests\n",
    "- designed for composable abstractions and layering\n",
    "- highly usable, encouraging unit tests by making it as easy, painless (avoiding boilerplate and other nonsense), and useful as possible to write them\n",
    "\n",
    "### Planned\n",
    "- ablity to target multiple backends and simulators (possibly requiring a link to Scala, if the testvector is not static, or using a limited test constructing API subset, when synthesizing to FPGA)\n",
    "- will be included in base chisel3, to avoid packaging and dependency nightmares\n",
