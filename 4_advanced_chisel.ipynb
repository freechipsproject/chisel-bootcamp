    "### Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Chisel is a framework that helps users write hardware generators.\n",
    "The idea is to encode a designer's methodology into a program that can be used to create many categories of a circuit.\n",
    "Some generators are very narrow in scope and can be used to generate a small set of designs, for example an adder parameterized by the width of its operands.\n",
    "Other generators are very broad in scope and can generate circuits with a wide range of architectures, for example a rocket core that can either be in-order or out-of-order.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most of the popular HDLs have some mechanisms for writing generators, but they are often difficult to use to write sophisticated generators because of limitations of the language.\n",
    "Chisel can make writing sophisticated generators much easier because it is hosted in Scala.\n",
    "This allows generator writers to use the powerful language features of Scala and the software development practices they enable that are not possible in HDLs.\n",
    "\n",
    "This module will cover:\n",
    "\n",
    "  - Writing parameterized modules\n",
    "  - Writing parameterized IOs, and advanced IO for generators\n",
    "  - Miscellaneous useful things like multiple clock domains, verilog blackboxing, and more"

    "### More Advanced Parameterization\n",
    "# TODO: capitalize SCALA\n",
    "The kind of parameterization shown in `Adder` and `VecAdder` is very basic.\n",
    "Chisel `Module`s are Scala classes, so anything that can be used as an argument to a Scala class constructor can be a parameter for a Chisel `Module`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here follows a few LFSR implementations that are parameterized differently.\n",
    "Note that the `io` for the `LFSR` is implemented as a separate class.\n",
    "This makes it easy to write multiple versions of the `LFSR` with the same IO interface.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first example is perhaps somewhat similar to how you would write this generator in a language like Verilog.\n",
    "The module has two parameters: number of state bits and an integer representing the feedback polynomial.\n",
    "If the `i`th LSB of `feedback` is high, the `i`th bit of state is included in the feedback.\n",
    "\n",
    "TODO: break up text with inline code\n",
    "\n",
    "In the second example, instead of representing `feedback` as an integer, we represent it as a function.\n",
    "`feedback` takes `UInt` as an argument and produces a `Bool`.\n",
    "This is possible because Scala is a functional programming language that treats functions as first class objects (you can pass them around as arguments and treat them like any other object).\n",
    "\n",
    "Is the second example better than the first?\n",
    "In this case, it made the code shorter (although defining `feedback` as a function may take more lines of code than defining it as an integer).\n",
    "Using a function in this case eliminates some bit manipulation code which can be hard to read or debug.\n",
    "One potential downside to having feedback defined as a function is that you could pass a function that has state or isn't linear, which would mean this is no longer an LFSR.\n",
    "\n",
    "The third example has one parameter: a list with `Booleans` that indicate if the bit in the corresponding position is included in the feedback polynomial.\n",
    "This avoids the bit manipulation code of the first example while still enforcing that you are actually building an LFSR.\n",
    "\n",
    "One thing to notice about the third example is that `n` is no longer a parameter.\n",
    "The number of bits of state is set by the length of the list being passed in.\n",

    "\n",
    "In the previous tutorial, we wrote a shift register. Unfortunately, it wasn't very flexible in what kind of inputs it could handle. If instead of a `Bool` we wanted a shift register for `SInt`, we would have to rewrite the shift register module.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Scala, objects and functions aren't the only things we can treat as parameters. We can also treat types as paramters.\n",
    "\n",
    "We usually need to provide a type constraint.\n",
    "In this case, we want to be able to put objects in a bundle, connect (`:=`) them, and create registers with them (`RegNext`).\n",
    "These operations cannot be done on arbitrary objects; for example `wire := 3` is illegal because Scala is statically typed.\n",
    "If we use a type constraint to say that type `T` is a subclass of `Data`, then we can use `:=` on any objects of type `T` because `:=` is defined for all `Data`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are two implementations of a simple shift register that take types as a parameter.\n",
    "The first is written using a loop, and the second is written using `foldLeft`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that the tester is also type parameterized!\n",
    "We created a trait called `HasShiftRegisterIO[T]` that says `io` is of type `ShiftRegisterIO`.\n",
    "The implementations of the shift register all include this trait, so the tester requires `T <: Module with HasShiftRegisterIO[V]`, which both `ShiftRegisterWithLoop[V]` and `ShiftRegister[V]` satisfy, so the tester can be used with both.\n",
    "The tester has a second type parameter `V`, which is an argument for the `HasShiftRegisterIO` trait.\n",
    "This unfortunately results in the Scala compiler having some trouble figuring out how to infer all the types, so we have to be explicit and write them out, e.g. `new ShiftRegisterTester[ShiftRegisterWithLoop[SInt], SInt]`."
