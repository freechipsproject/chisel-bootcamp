Proper selection of weights can perform AND, OR, NOT, and other binary functions. Since NOT requires a bias (which we did not implement) and XOR requires chaining multiple neurons, we'll test our neuron just with AND and OR logic. Complete the following tester to check our neuron with the step function.\n",
